# Glean API

This is the backend for a web application used to plan farming or gardening plantings and track harvests.  Users will be able to:
* Keep track of when they planted crops over the season and visualize timelines.
* Track harvest quantities and dates.
* Use this data to project future schedules and plans.

This application is a fully serverless stack written in Python and built with AWS services and utilizing CDK for infrastructure as code.
